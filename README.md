# WeatherApp
This script uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI with an entry field for the city name and a button to get the weather. When the button is clicked,
it calls the get_weather function, which sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data for the specified city. It then updates the 
GUI with the temperature, humidity, and description of the weather.

To use this script, you will need to sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap
